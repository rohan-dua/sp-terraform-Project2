# sp-terraform-Project2
creates a vm using ubuntu and uses provisioner remote-exec to install a simple webpage on apache2. Also ensure that password for the vm is fetched from azure security manager using data sources. Also i would like to convert this vm to an image and then use the image to create a scale set that provision one vm each in each zone of the region.
